## III. What and why?

Computer Science is one of the most popular majors across the world and one of the most prominent fields for career and academic research.
Although it is easy to learn coding from online resources nowadays, finding an all-in-one application to learn, discuss and implement can sometimes be cumbersome.

**Product Vision Statement**: **OpenEdu** will be a one-stop shop enabling CS students and enthusiasts of all skill levels to learn CS via materials from well-known universities, discuss with others, and contribute knowledge to the platform.

## IV. For whom?

OpenEdu is designed for the following audience:

- **Computer Science students** who are required to learn a broad range of topics related to CS
- **people in CS-related industries** like Database Management Systems and SDE as a whole. 

For students, their schools do not necessarily offer the best curriculum with sufficient infrastructures like labs and assignments that can effectively improve their overall understanding of certain fields: OpenEdu collects well-known courses worldwide to flatten their learning curve and offer well-rounded learning resources. 

For people in the industry, OpenEdu can serve as a platform to have a complete review of certain filed's most fundamental knowledge and a good introduction collections of the fields one would like to know about.

## V. How?

### Themes&Features

The platform is composed of three main themes: 

1. Course :

    - A user can choose from subjects that he or she is interested in, like Data Structure, Operating Systems, and so on;
    - In each subject, there will be multiple courses the user can choose from:
        - e.g. MIT's ``S6.081`` and UC Berkeley's ``CS162`` are both for Operating Systems;
    - There will be a short introduction to the courses along with prerequisites, languages the course uses, estimated time to complete the course work, and so on;
    - The videos for the lectures will be offered, along with the official page for the course and reference repositories or other sites that may benefit the learner.
   
2. User :

    - We would encourage user to have accounts for the community features, but we allow visitors as well;
    - Under each video, users can share comments, which can be deleted, liked, disliked, and replied to;
    - Markdown blogs are supported: the home page is aiming to be a Blog site for the user that can share knowledge with the public;
    - The user can give suggestions to us, offer website advice, or recommend new courses that the user finds good.

3. Community :

    - For each subject, there is a "community" page that is used as a discussion board;
    - Users can ask for helps with technical issues and questions derived from the courses and find study buddies (similar to a simplified version of *Reddit*).
